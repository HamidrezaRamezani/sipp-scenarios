# sipp-scenarios

We are using SIPp application to test FreeSwitch and Asterisk.

List of Our scenarios:
1- Registering SIP users in Asterisk
2- Generating SIP calls to test Asterisk maximum CPS
3- Generating SIP calls to test FreeSwitch


Note:
During the tests, specially FreeSwitch, I have found some problems with SIPp which can't  handle the 407 proxy authorization request from FreeSwitch properly. Use my scenario files to solve the issues.
